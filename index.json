PnP is generally preferred for strictness, but node_modules incur less friction. The default configuration does not utilize Yarn Zero-Installs, which are usually enabled by default in new projects.    The template contains a mkdocs-material documentation website, which is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages, using GitHub Actions.\n  Additionally, it contains:\n  A TypeScript-authored JavaScript library, built with tsc (to get fully-featured TypeScript definitions).\n  A NodeJS application, that uses the library and is built with esbuild.\nThis is https://github.com/oliversalzburg/yarn3-typescript-nodejs-esbuild adopted for a monorepo.\n  A web application, that uses the library and is built with snowpack.\nThis is https://github.com/oliversalzburg/yarn3-typescript-web-snowpack adopted for a monorepo.\n    Code quality assistence through EditorConfig + Prettier + lint-staged.\n A git pre-commit hook for lint-staged is created through Yarn.
