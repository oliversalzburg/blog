[{"content":"yarn3-hugo Project Template I\u0026rsquo;ve added a new project template to quickly set up a Hugo-based website, like this blog.\nCheck it out: https://github.com/oliversalzburg/yarn3-hugo\nKey Features   The project repository and dependencies are to be managed with modern Yarn (Berry/v2/v3).\n Yarn Plug \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; Play, or PnP has been disabled in favor of using node_modules. PnP is generally preferred for strictness, but node_modules incur less friction. The default configuration does not utilize Yarn Zero-Installs, which are usually enabled by default in new projects.    The project\u0026rsquo;s primary output is a static website, built with Hugo.\n  Deploys to GitHub Pages, using GitHub Actions.\n  Code quality assistence through EditorConfig + Prettier + lint-staged.\n A git pre-commit hook for lint-staged is created through Yarn. Husky is strictly discouraged.    Enables Renovate to keep dependencies updated. The dependency dashboard is disabled.\n  Where possible, Markdown formatting has been adjusted to conform to Python-Markdown, so that it will work well with MkDocs. mkdocs-material is the suggested route to adopt documentation.\n  How to use To use this template, go to https://github.com/oliversalzburg/yarn3-hugo and click Use this template.\n","permalink":"https://oliversalzburg.github.io/blog/posts/yarn3-hugo-project-template/","title":"yarn3-hugo Project Template"}]
