# Introducing PlantDB

For many years, I've been searching for a proper tool to record information about my house plants. I've tried several apps over the years and, let's cut it short, they are all absolute shit. Either they are very poorly designed or they are designed in a way that your data is locked in forever and/or unusable outside their application and they either make you pay money for premium features, spy on you, sell your information, or simply just go out of business and then you're left with garbage data and a garbage app.

I am done with these horrible solutions and am finally building my own.
